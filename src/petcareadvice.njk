    <h2>Feeding</h2>
    <p>Ensure that your pet has access to fresh water at all times and follow proper feeding schedules. Depending on your pet's age, size, and breed, their nutritional needs will vary.</p>

    <h2>Exercise and Playtime</h2>
    <p>Keep your pet active with regular walks, playtime, and mental stimulation. This helps reduce anxiety and keeps them healthy.</p>

    <h2>Medical Care</h2>
    <p>Regular check-ups with a vet are essential to monitor your pet's health. Make sure they are up-to-date with vaccinations and flea/tick treatments.</p>

    <h2>Behavioral Training</h2>
    <p>Training your pet can help prevent behavioral issues and strengthen your bond. Positive reinforcement techniques work best!</p>
    
    <h2>Emergency Contacts</h2>
    <p>Keep the contact information for a trusted veterinarian and animal emergency services handy in case of an emergency.</p>
